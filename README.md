<br/>Figure 1: Expected render.

Rubric:

1. Functions for each of the figures were included. *The function for the sphere is missing.*
2. Vertex data was created, and the correct information for each object was added. *Missing the sphere data.*
3. Correct transformations were performed for each figure. *Applied transformations, but not placed as expected.*
4. The figures were rendered as in the Figure. *Figures are not placed as expected.*

**Notes**
1. *There was a copy/paste error with the model view matrix in the Figures.html file.*
2. *The figures are not correctly placed in the canvas. Minor issue, but still need to be corrected.*
3. *To create the sphere, a set of triangles was needed, and using the primitive TRIANGLE_FAN you could have rendered that set.*

**Grade: 75**

*Add a symbolic link or a shortcut to the libs library to get the assignment to work.*
